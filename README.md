[Team 670 Robot Code for 2014](http://homesteadrobotics.com/)
=========

This robot likes big balls.

This is a the robot code repostiory for [FRC Team 670](http://homesteadrobotics.com/) for the 2014 First Robotics Competition Game, Arial Assist.

To be able to run this code, you have to properly set up both your netbeans installation and router on your robot. Further instructions can be found [here](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/7885/l/79405-installing-the-java-development-tools).

This robot code works on a cRIO (Standard FRC Robot Controller for 2014). It probably will not work on future FIRST Robotics Contollers.

Most of our code is found under [src/org/homestead/robotics](/src/org/homestead/robotics).
